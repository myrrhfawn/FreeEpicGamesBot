Hello, 
this is my first simple bot parser written in Python. 
Its main purpose is to send free games on https://www.epicgames.com

The bot is written using the telebot framework. Other libraries such as flask, request, json are also used.

To get a free game, you need to run this bot in Telegram and send a command /free
Bot Telegram ID:@FreeEpicGamesBot_bot

At the moment, the bot is not hosted on the site, so it does not work.
